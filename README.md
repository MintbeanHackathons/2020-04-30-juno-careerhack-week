# Juno CareerWeek - Day 2 - HackerNews Clone

Today, and over the weekend, we will be creating a Hacker News clone.

You can go back to Day 1 here: [Day 1](./pages/Day1.md)

# Feature Roadmap

## Authentication 

Simple username/password based.

This works as it does on HN. You do NOT need to do 'forgot password'.

Your options include:
1. https://auth0.com 
2. https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth
3. Roll your own (advanced)
4. Store username/passwords in the code.

## Articles

Unlike HN, you will only have a single type of article. The article will have:

1. Title
1. URL (Optional field)
1. Description (Optional field)

Clicking on the title of the article should take you to the URL.

## Comment chains (Optional feature)

This works as it does on HN.

## Points & upvote/downvote system (Optional feature)

This works as it does on HN.

## Search (Optional feature)

This works as it does on HN.

# Roadmap

Each section can be built independently using dummy data and dummy methods.

It is suggested that you split up the project in a way that makes sense for your particular team and the strengths of your team members.
