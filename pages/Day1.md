# Juno CareerWeek - Day 1 - Learning to learn

After graduation, self-learning becomes the #1 most important practice to maintain and grow. Using self-learning to get over technical hurdles is the single most important thing that professional software developers do on a daily basis, whether they are currently employed or not.

As such, the project will be used to teach everyone how to deal with technical unknowns effectively using self-learning.

The whole point is to learn to deal with unknowns fearlessly. So this project is intentionally designed to be vague and light in details. 

## Outcomes for Monday

The first outcome is: learning to deal with technical unknowns effectively, using various online resources, documentation, and experimentation.

The second outcome is: everyone will walk out of this project with a beautiful and visually appealing full stack project they can put on their own portfolio, individually.

## Today's objectives

Today's objectives are divided into two sections: 

Phase 1: Individual work
Phase 2: Group work

## INDIVIDUAL WORK PHASE

This phase is an individual contribution phase. 

IMPORTANT!: During this phase, do not ask for help from others. Instead, try to solve your tasks on your own, OR ask Monarch questions via direct message. There is no penalty for "cheating", but as your 5th grade teacher probably told you, "you'll only be cheating yourself".

#### Here are your instructions:

This project contains a simple Vanilla JS single page application + Express server. 

1. INDIVIDUALLY, everyone will fork + star this repository.
1. INDIVIDUALLY, please read the code and familiarize yourself with it fully, starting with `index.js` and Googling documentation as required.
1. INDIVIDUALLY, everyone will deploy the project as-is on their own server.
1. INDIVIDUALLY, everyone will ensure that their own server is accessible via the browser.
1. INDIVIDUALLY, everyone will ensure that their data is saving on the server, even when accessed on another device.
1. INDIVIDUALLY, if any bugs are discovered or improvements made, you will contribute those changes back to the main repo.

Your best options for server technology are below. Please choose what you think is the best fit for you, given the descriptions below:
  * https://aws.amazon.com/free/ (needs credit card, great learning opportunity)
  * https://cloud.google.com/free (needs credit card, great learning opportunity)
  * https://heroku.com (needs credit card, not as full of learning as the above)
  * https://vercel.com/ (no credit card needed, easiest, but least learning opportunitites)

There is no formal time limit to this phase. You can take all day if you wish.

### The general strategy:

Here are your tasks for today:
  1. Create a server.
  1. Start your express app on the server.
  1. Ensure you can access the app over the internet.
  1. Ensure the app functions on your server exactly the same way it does on your laptop.

1. For any problems, follow this algorithm:
  1. For a full 1 hour, try to solve hurdles using Google and Stack Overflow
  1. If you cannot find a good solution, take a 15-30 minute break, then come back. (this is "idea incubation")

## GROUP WORK PHASE

After finishing the above individual work phase, you will begin working in groups to convert the project from using the `data` variable in `data-service.js` to actually using a real MongoDB database. (Some will begin this today, and it will be continued tomorrow)

# Groups

## Group 1

Leader: Norman Hussey
Naveen Malhotra

## About the lead role
The lead role is really more coordinating and task management than technical.
There is no responsibility on the leads' part to be a technical guide.
